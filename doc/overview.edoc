@title Welcome to Argos monitor and reporter
@doc Argos is a monitoring and reporting tool designed for handling
uncertain and dynamic situations. Instead of comparing metrics to
hard limits (don't worry, it can still do this), it focuses on comparing
services against each other to find aberrant behaviour.
